# sortpuz-solver

**Purpose:**
Solve a level from Sortpuz mobile game from a screenshot.

**How to Test:**
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Run `test_img_parse.py`, in the root folder
4. It will plot the parsed `game2.jpeg` screenshot

**Observations**
As of now, it only uses hard-coded rules to parse a screenshot into python objects.

The next step is to create the solving algorithm.
